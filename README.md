# PetBook
## Project #46 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
PetBook is a ReactJS social network for pets. Users can view a pet's profile (containing their name, bio, and friends list) and navigate to other pet profiles. 
## What I Learned
  - React component lifecycle methods - hooking actions to specific moments in a component's life, such as when the component is loading or gets updated
  - componentDidMount(), componentWillUnmount(), and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods
